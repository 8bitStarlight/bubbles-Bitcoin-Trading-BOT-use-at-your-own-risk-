source code (intentionally left incomplete) wrote by Alessio Ricco, Emanuele De Cupis

this project is a Bitcoin Trading BOT wrote in 2013.
this repository is not complete because we decided to abandon the project after the mtgox close down

you will find the source code and the classes we used, but we intentionally removed some other files (mainly configurations, libraries and unit tests)
use it as source of inspiration because inside those c# classes maybe you'll find some interesting routines for technical analysis, trading on the main BTC markets, and so on

Use this code at your own risks, it's an old project and we don't assume any responsabilities if you use it for your trading activities.

enjoy!

Alessio, Emanuele
